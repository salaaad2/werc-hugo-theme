# WERC hugo theme

This is a hugo theme made in an evening that replicates (or rather steals) the default look of werc-generated pages.

werc is a so-called anti-framework for generating static sites, much like hugo. You can see what it is about [here](http://werc.cat-v.org/).

I basically copied the css and set a bunch of values in layout/* until it was PERFECT.
